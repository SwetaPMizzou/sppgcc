# Software Engineering Ethics #

  * ### Protect your users’ data ! ###
With great power comes great responsibility.” This is a further reason, even above their general ethical obligations as human beings, that software engineers have special ethical obligations to the public they serve. For example:
Implement password resetting rather than recovery. Store passwords in encrypted form. Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.Well aware of the policies of the clients.

* ### Be honest, give credit where it is due ! ###
Borrowing ideas is how we learn and progress. But if you use borrowed or stolen code, at least comment that it is.But rarely do we try to really imagine what it will be like to suffer the pain that our action is likely going to cause someone – or what it will be like to experience the joy, or relief of pain or worry that another choice of ours might bring.

* ### Strong sense of individual responsibility ! ###
Maintaining Standards of Quality counts towards not only a high throughput but also gaining the confidence of the public/client.
